# Final Test Commit

**Date**: 2025-06-20
**Purpose**: Final test to verify line ending fix

## Summary
This file tests if the Git line ending configuration changes have resolved the commit issues.

The changes made:
1. Added .gitattributes file with proper line ending rules
2. Set core.autocrlf=false
3. Set core.safecrlf=false

This should allow commits to be created without line ending warnings blocking the process.
